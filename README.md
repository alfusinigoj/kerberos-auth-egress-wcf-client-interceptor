### PivotalServices.WcfClient.Kerberos.Interceptor

Stable versions are available at www.nuget.org https://www.nuget.org/packages/PivotalServices.WcfClient.Kerberos.Interceptor (please refer to the note at the end for more details)

This package will add a Wcf client interceptor which will injects kerberos ticket for egress requests. This should be used together with the supply buildpack https://github.com/alfusinigoj/route-service-auth-egress-buildpack to make it fully functional

#### Below are the important developer instructions, to follow after installation of this package

1. Add the supply buildpack from "https://github.com/alfusinigoj/route-service-auth-egress-buildpack/releases" in the CF manifest (preferably the latest release). 
   IMPORTANT: Make sure the application is built/published with target platform 'x64'
2. Follow the readme of https://github.com/alfusinigoj/route-service-auth-egress-buildpack to setup the sources for kerberos config and keytab files
   For kerberos config template, please here https://github.com/alfusinigoj/route-service-auth-egress-wcf-client-interceptor/blob/master/src/RouteServiceIwaWcfInterceptor/krb5.ini
3. Set the correct client UPN in AppSettings with key 'ClientUserPrincipalName' as below (this section will be already added by the package)
```xml
  <appSettings>
		<add key="ClientUserPrincipalName" value="client_username@domain" />
  </appSettings>
```
4. Target service UPN has to be provided in the client/endpoint/identity configuration as in the sample below. If not, system will try to use the SPN 'host/foo.bar' (based on the below sample)
```xml
  <system.serviceModel>
		<client>
		  <endpoint address="http://foo.bar/myservice.svc" 
					binding="basicHttpBinding" 
					bindingConfiguration="BasicHttpBinding" 
					contract="MyService.IService" 
					name="BasicHttpBinding_IService"
					behaviorConfiguration ="myIwaInterceptorBehavior">
					<identity>
						<userPrincipalName value="target_user@domain" />
					</identity>
		  </endpoint>
		</client>
	</system.serviceModel>
  ```
5. To see debug logs, please set the log level to "Debug" or "Trace", via environment variable "PivotalIwaWcfClientInterceptor:LogLevel:Default"
